# Chapter Ⅱ<br>Foreword


    If you put clay pieces together, they turn into a big piece.
    
    But, you couldn't do the same way with branches.
    
    When you didn't get the shape of the branch you wanted, you should uproot the tree..
    
    We should take care of the environment so it can't be a good way.

    By the way, don't forget that it's Arbor Day on April 5th in Korea. :)
